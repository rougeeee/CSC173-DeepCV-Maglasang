## 1. Dataset Progress
- **Total images:** [e.g., 4,200]
- **Train/Val/Test split:** [e.g., 70%/15%/15% or 2,940/630/630]
- **Classes implemented:** [e.g., 6 classes: plastic, metal, paper, glass, organic, other]
- **Preprocessing applied:** Resize(640), normalization, augmentation (flip, rotate, brightness)

**Current Metrics:**
| Metric | Train | Val |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Loss | [0.45] | [0.62] |
| mAP@0.5 | [78%] | [72%] |
| Precision | [0.81] | [0.75] |
| Recall | [0.73] | [0.68] |

## 3. Challenges Encountered & Solutions
| Issue | Status | Resolution |
|-------|--------|------------|
| CUDA out of memory | ✅ Fixed | Reduced batch_size from 32→16 |
| Class imbalance | ⏳ Ongoing | Added class weights to loss function |
| Slow validation | ⏳ Planned | Implement early stopping |

## 4. Next Steps (Before Final Submission)
- [ ] Complete training (50 more epochs)
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, augmentations)
- [ ] Baseline comparison (vs. original pre-trained model)
- [ ] Record 5-min demo video
- [ ] Write complete README.md with results
